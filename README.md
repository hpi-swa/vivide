A programming environment and framework that supports *interactive*, *data-driven*, *scriptable* construction of graphical tools with low effort. It is implemented in Squeak/Smalltalk.

## How to Install [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hpi-swa/vivide.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/hpi-swa/vivide)

1. Get [Squeak 5.3 or later](http://www.squeak.org) with a recent [OpenSmalltalkVM](https://github.com/OpenSmalltalk/opensmalltalk-vm) for your operating system.
2. If not already integrated, load [Metacello](https://github.com/dalehenrich/metacello-work). Learn how it [works](https://github.com/dalehenrich/metacello-work/blob/master/docs/MetacelloUserGuide.md).
3. Finally, load VIVIDE into your Squeak image:

```Smalltalk
Metacello new
  baseline: 'Vivide';
  repository: 'github://hpi-swa/vivide:master/repository';
 "get; --- for updates" 
  load.
```

Then, create and enter a new *animated Morphic project*. There, your can open Vivide with ```VivideLight open```.

See [FAQ](https://github.com/hpi-swa/vivide/wiki/FAQ) for further information.
